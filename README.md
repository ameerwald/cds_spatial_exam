# Spatial Analytics Final Exam 

## The data

This data comes from the US Census Bureau and was accessed using the tidycensus package in R. More information about the data and the package can be found [here](https://walker-data.com/census-r/the-united-states-census-and-the-r-programming-language.html). 

## Assignment description

For this assignment I did an exploration of a small sample of US census data, looking at the median income of school districts in the state Minnesota. 

## To run the script

In order to run this R markdown file, you will need to go to [this](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html) website and sign up to get an API key. 

In the script it will say "YOUR API KEY HERE" where you should insert yours. Without doing this, the code will not run correctly or at all.
